GunFu Deadlands V1.00
---------------------

Notes:
-  The game was made using Love2D.  Thus, it has the same dependencies as the love package.  You may
need to install some of the following packages, if they are not already in the system:
  libgl1
  liblua5.1-0
  libphysfs-1.0-0
  libsdl-mixer1.2
  libsdl1.2debian
  livdevil1c2

GunFu Deadlands V1.01
------------------------------------

This is an update of the game.  It's a port of the game to the current Löve2D 0.7.2.
The game is still the same, I only made it work with the latest version of Löve.

The dependencies are the ones from Love2d.  According to synaptic they are:
libdevil1c2
libfreetype6
libgl1-mesa-glx
liblua5.1-0
libphysfs-1.0-0
libsdl1.2debian
libopenal1
libogg0
libvorbis0a
libvorbisfile3
libflac8
libflac++6
libmodplug0c2
libmpg123-0
libc6
libgcc1
libphysfs1
libstdc++6

They should be automatically resolved if you install love from your package manager.
